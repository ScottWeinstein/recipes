* 1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, drained and chopped 
* 3 tablespoons dried currants or raisins, soaked and drained 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* 7 saffron strands or 1/2 teaspoon powdered saffron 
* 1 pound dried bucatini

1. In a hot skillet, add olive oil and saute fennel until caramelized
1. Add the onions, currants, tomatoes, pine nuts and saffron
1. Season with salt and pepper
1. Bring the briefly to a boil and then lower to a simmer
1. Add the reserved sardines and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sardines have broken into pieces and are thoroughly mixed into the sauce, about 10-15 minutes. 
1. If the sauce appears too thick at this point, add a little of the pasta cooking water
1. Bring 6 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a rolling boil
1. Add the bucatini and cook until tender but still al dente. 
1. Drain the cooked pasta into a large serving bowl, add 3/4 of the sauce and stir to combine.
