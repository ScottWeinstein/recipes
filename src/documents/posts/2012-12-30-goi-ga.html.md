# Vietnamese chicken salad

![Goi Ga](http://www.nicegraphics.com/chow/hoanh_long/goi_ga.jpg)

## Notes
I often double or triple the ingredients. The full recipe can take well over an hour to prepare, though if you skip the optional parts, as little as 30-45 min

## Ingredients
* ½ Chicken breast on the bone with skin
* ½ Green Cabbage
* ½ White onion
* 2 Limes
* ½ Cup Vinegar
* 4 Small red chillis peppers 
* Fish Sauce (Nam Pla) (Tiparos is a good brand) 
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Fresh mint
* Sugar
* Salt
* Cilantro
* Vegetable oil
* 10 – 15 Garlic cloves
* **Optional**
    * 3 Shallots
    * Unsalted toasted shelled peanuts

## Preparation
* Make dressing for cabbage
* Fast pickle the cabbage
* Shred chicken
* Create garlic oil
* Prep final dressings
* Mix and server

### Dressing for cabbage
Mix ½ cup vinegar + ¼ tsp sugar + ½ tsp salt


### Fast pickle the cabbage
1. Shred cabbage and onion (thinly)
1. Soak in _dressing for cabbage_ for at least 10 min, though 30 - 60 while other steps are in progress is fine
1. Squeeze hard, by hand, the cabbage and onion mix to remove excess water
    * This is absolutely required, a salad spinner just does not do the trick here. Wrapping the cabbage in strong cheese cloth can help

### Chicken dressing
* ½ tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp fish sauce
* 1/3 cup chopped mint
* juice from ½ lime
  
### Chicken
* Broil, grill, bake, boil, or roast chicken
* Let cool
* Shred and mix with _Chicken dressing_
* If you want to boil:
    1. Med flame, boil chicken for 15 min
    1. Let soak for 15 min
    1. Transfer to ice water and let cool

### Final Dressing
* 2 Tbsp fish sauce
* 1 – 2 Tbsp sugar 
* Juice from 1 lime
* 1 – 4 thai red bird chilis finely sliced with seeds
* ¼ cup chopped cilantro

### Crisped garlic & garlic oil
* Mince 5-10 cloves
* Heat 1 – 2 cups of oil over low flame 
* When garlic is medium brown (about 10-20 min) strain oil (but **save it**)
* Dry garlic on paper towels
* Let garlic oil cool

### Crisped shallots (optional)
* Mince 3 shallots
* Heat oil over very low flame 
* When shallots are medium brown (about 10-20 min) strain oil. Careful – easy to burn.
* Dry shallots on paper towels

    3) 1/8 cup of  (optional)


### How to serve
